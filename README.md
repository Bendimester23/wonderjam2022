Story:
You fond your self as a GOD (not backwards dog) in a random rod of Earth, but you lived in a box until now so you can only imagine excavator's and powergenerator's (at least a few).
Everything has a price, but you can sell the stuff you have in your inventory, and the god government pays you for your extra energy.
